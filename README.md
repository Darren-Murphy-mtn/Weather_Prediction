##  Overview

The Mount Rainier Weather Prediction Tool is a comprehensive system designed to help climbers make informed decisions about attempting to summit Mount Rainier (14,411 feet / 4,392 meters). This tool combines advanced machine learning techniques with multiple weather data sources to provide:

- **72-hour weather forecasts** for the summit area
- **Safety risk assessments** based on predicted conditions
- **Climbing recommendations** and optimal timing windows
- **Emergency alerts** for dangerous weather conditions

###  Why This Tool Exists

Mount Rainier is one of the most dangerous mountains in the United States, with rapidly changing weather conditions that can create life-threatening situations. Traditional weather forecasts often don't provide the specific, elevation-adjusted predictions needed for safe climbing decisions. This tool addresses that gap by:

1. **Focusing on summit conditions** rather than base-level weather
2. **Combining multiple data sources** for more accurate predictions
3. **Providing safety-focused analysis** rather than just weather data
4. **Using machine learning** to identify patterns that human forecasters might miss
